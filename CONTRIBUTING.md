# Contribution Guidelines

## Documentation

The default language for text is English, contributions in other languages should be accompanied by an English
translation if at all possible. If you are not comfortable enough in English to provide it along with your contribution
of another language, please create an issue in the repo's issue tracker to ask for assistance. 

Keep it simple, keep it conversational. Ask yourself, "Would someone completely unfamiliar with this understand it?"

["Corporate speak"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_jargon) should be avoided, and any new jargon or acronyms should be defined immediately after their first use.

Use links to products the first time they are mentioned.

New documentation should be submitted in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).


## Code: Yaml

Yaml files should contain `---` on their first line and `...` on their last line. Two space indents should be used.


## Commit signing

Signing commits with your PGP/GPG key is encouraged but not required.
