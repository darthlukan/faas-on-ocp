# Functions as a Service on Openshift Container Platform

Author: Brian Tomlinson <btomlins@redhat.com> / <darthlukan@gmail.com>


## Description

This repo will contain everything one needs to get started with Functions as a Service on [Openshift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform/) 
locally via [Minishift](https://www.okd.io/minishift/). 

The plan is to have docs which outline FaaS and core "Serverless" concepts, as well as Ansible playbooks and roles 
that will set up the local environment and, optionally, setup simple FaaS use-cases for demo / educational purposes.

The current focus is to use Apache Openwhisk on Openshift. As development continues, other Serverless/FaaS software may
be added. The core point is that these items allow users to easily comprehend and get started with Faas on Openshift.


## Getting started

TBD!
